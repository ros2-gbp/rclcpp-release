ros-rolling-rclcpp (0.5.0-2focal) focal; urgency=high

  * Fixed a bug in the multi-threaded executor which could cause it to take a timer (potentially other types of wait-able items) more than once to be worked one. (#383 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/383>)
    * Specifically this could result in a timer getting called more often that it should when using the multi-threaded executor.
  * Added functions that allow you to publish serialized messages and received serialized messages in your subscription callback. (#388 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/388>)
  * Changed code to always get the Service name from ``rcl`` to ensure the remapped name is returned. (#498 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/498>)
  * Added previously missing ``set_parameters_atomically()`` method to the Service client interface. (#494 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/494>)

  * Added ability to initialize parameter values in a node with an argument to the Node constructor. (#486 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/486>)

  * Fixed a flaky ROS time test due to not spinning before getting the time. (#483 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/483>)
  * Nodes now autostart the ROS parameter services which let you get, set, and list parameters in a node. (#478 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/478>)
  * Added support for arrays in Parameters. (#443 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/443>)
  * Changed how executors use ``AnyExecutable`` objects so that they are a reference instead of a shared pointer, in order to avoid memory allocation in the "common case". (#463 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/463>)
  * Added ability to pass command line arguments to the Node constructor. (#461 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/461>)
  * Added an argument to specify the number of threads a multithreaded executor should create. (#442 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/442>)

  * Added the scale operation to ``rclcpp::Duration``.
    * Signed-off-by: jwang <mailto:jing.j.wang@intel.com>

    * Signed-off-by: Ethan Gao <mailto:ethan.gao@linux.intel.com>
  * Changed to use ``rcl_count_publishers()`` like API's rather than the lower level ``rmw_count_publishers()`` API. (#425 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/425>)
    * Signed-off-by: Sriram Raghunathan <mailto:rsriram7@visteon.com>
