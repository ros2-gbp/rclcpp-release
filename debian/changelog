    * Fix warnings on Windows. (#2692 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/2692>)
    For reasons I admit I do not understand, the deprecation
    warnings for StaticSingleThreadedExecutor on Windows
    happen when we construct a shared_ptr for it in the tests.
    If we construct a regular object, then it is fine.  Luckily
    this test does not require a shared_ptr, so just make it
    a regular object here, which rixes the warning.
    While we are in here, make all of the tests camel case to
    be consistent.

  * Omnibus fixes for running tests with Connext. (backport #2684 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/2684>) (#2690 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/2690>)
    * Omnibus fixes for running tests with Connext. (#2684 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/2684>)
    * Omnibus fixes for running tests with Connext.
    When running the tests with RTI Connext as the default
    RMW, some of the tests are failing.  There are three
    different failures fixed here:
    1.  Setting the liveliness duration to a value smaller than
    a microsecond causes Connext to throw an error.  Set it to
    a millisecond.
    2.  Using the SystemDefaultsQoS sets the QoS to KEEP_LAST 1.
    Connext is somewhat slow in this regard, so it can be the case
    that we are overwriting a previous service introspection event
    with the next one.  Switch to the ServicesDefaultQoS in the test,
    which ensures we will not lose events.
    3.  Connext is slow to match publishers and subscriptions.  Thus,
    when creating a subscription "on-the-fly", we should wait for the
    publisher to match it before expecting the subscription to actually
    receive data from it.
    With these fixes in place, the test_client_common, test_generic_service,
    test_service_introspection, and test_executors tests all pass for
    me with rmw_connextdds.
    * Fixes for executors.
    * One more fix for services.
    * More fixes for service_introspection.
    * More fixes for introspection.

  * Split test_executors.cpp even further. (#2572 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/2572>) (#2619 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/2619>)
    That's because it is too large for Windows Debug to compile,
    so split into smaller bits.
    Even with this split, the file is too big; that's likely
    because we are using TYPED_TEST here, which generates multiple
    symbols per test case.  To deal with this, without further
    breaking up the file, also add in the /bigobj flag when
    compiling on Windows Debug.

  * fix flakiness in TestTimersManager unit-test (#2468 <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/2468>)
    the previous version of the test was relying on the assumption that a timer with 1ms period gets called at least 6 times if the main thread waits 15ms. this is true most of the times, but it's not guaranteed, especially when running the test on windows CI servers. the new version of the test makes no assumptions on how much time it takes for the timers manager to invoke the timers, but rather focuses on ensuring that they are called the right amount of times, which is what's important for the purpose of the test

    Mostly by ensuring we aren't attempting to store
    large messages on the stack.  Also add in tests.

  * Remove unsafe get_callback_groups API.
    Callers should change to using for_each_callback_group(), or
    store the callback groups they need internally.
  * Add in callback_groups_for_each.
    The main reason to add this method in is to make accesses to the
    callback_groups_ vector thread-safe.  By having a
    callback_groups_for_each that accepts a std::function, we can
    just have the callers give us the callback they are interested
    in, and we can take care of the locking.
    The rest of this fairly large PR is cleaning up all of the places
    that use get_callback_groups() to instead use
    callback_groups_for_each().

    * Fixed up includes of ``clock.hpp/cpp``.
    * Added documentation for exceptions to ``clock.hpp``.
    * Adjusted function signature of getters of ``clock.hpp/cpp``.
    * Removed raw pointers to ``Clock::create_jump_callback``.
    * Removed unnecessary ``rclcpp`` namespace reference from ``clock.cpp``.

    * Specifically this could result in a timer getting called more often that it should when using the multi-threaded executor.
